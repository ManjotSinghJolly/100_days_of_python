# Flash Card Program

## Overview

This project is a flashcard application built using Python and the Tkinter library. The application helps users learn French vocabulary by displaying flashcards with French words on one side and their English translations on the other. Users can mark words as known, and the program will save the progress.

## Features

- Display flashcards with French words.
- Flip the card to reveal the English translation after a short delay.
- Mark words as known to remove them from the learning list.
- Save progress to a CSV file to retain known words between sessions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included with Python installations)
- pandas library for handling data

You can install the `pandas` library using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```
