# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter

## Overview

This project is a simple Python program that converts a given word into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet representation. The program reads the phonetic alphabet data from a CSV file, stores it in a dictionary, and then uses this dictionary to translate user-input words into phonetic codes.

## Features

- Reads NATO phonetic alphabet data from a CSV file.
- Converts user-input words into NATO phonetic alphabet codes.
- Handles non-alphabetic input gracefully by prompting the user to enter valid input.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library

## Files

- `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv`: A CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet data.
- `phonetic_converter.py`: The main Python script that performs the conversion.
